# dotfiles

This Section will contain all the dot files that are used to initialize my working environment. Updated as and when I get the time to do so

cshrc -->
Since primary work is in tcsh, this directory will contain the .cshrc and .tcshrc files that I am working with

screenrc -->
Once upon a time I experimented with screen and this is the rc file I used. Kept here to preserve the file so that I dont have to start from scratch again

tmuxrc -->
Shifted to tmux from screen. This is the final configuration for tmux that I am currently working with

vimrc -->
Over the years these settings have evolved to include different libraries.
